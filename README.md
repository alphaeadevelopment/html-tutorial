# Learning HTML

## Prerequisites

This less assumes you have completed the initial set-up in branch `master`.

## Tables

It's time to explore some more HTML elements.

Tables are often used to display data in a grid. They consist of a nested structure of `table`, `thead`, `tbody`, `tr` (row), `th` (header cell) and `td` (regular cell) elements.

Try creating a table of some data - just 3 rows and 2 or 3 columns for now. You can decide what data to use, think of something you're interested in, whether it's footballers (name, team, nationality) or music (singer, band, latest album).

## Lists

Lists can be ordered or unordered. Unordered lists typically have bullet points, while ordered lists are given a numerical indicator (1, 2, 3, 4 etc.) or (i, ii, iii, iv, etc.)

Create an unordered list (`ul`) with a few list items (`li`). The content can be anything, you choose - your favourite bands, sports you're interested... whatever you like.

## Headers

We have a top-level header (`h1`) for the whole page. Now add a second-level header (`h2`) for both your table and your list.
